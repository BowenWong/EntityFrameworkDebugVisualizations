Current TODOs
----------------------------------------
Visualization
	Relation tooltip should include the state of the relation (at least unchanged/added, better if I could also display removed relations)

Add test cases
	assert expectations about the produced graph for different scenarios

Dump graph as text for DebugExtensions (base DumpTrackedEntities on graph)
Start visualizer via extension method

Update readme.md (add better description, change repo name and reference used projects!)
Add NuGet package


Future Improvements
----------------------------------------
Visualization
	Multiple relations between identical vertices are not displayed correctly (only the first relation is visible)
	Relation tooltip needs some styling
	Relations could be collapsible (hide related vertices and the edges leading to them)
	Add edge lables (relation name), might be best to switch to GraphX

	Figure out a way to set ZoomBox Mode to Original (1:1) initially => GraphX might improve this, too
