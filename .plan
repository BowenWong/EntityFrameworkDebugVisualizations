TODOs
--------------------
Create graph of DbContext entries
	Entities
		Fix lies for added entities (see #warning in GraphBuilder)

	Relations
		State?
		Type (Multiplicity? Required?)
		Fix for null references (see #warning in GraphBuilder) => display twice, as relation AND as property?

Improve visualization
	Fix property description for added/removed entities
	How do I display removed relations? Can I? How do I distinguish between unchanged and added?
	How do I (nicely) show collection relations (and distinguish them from scalar relations)?
	Relation tooltip needs styling (and should include more information, see above)

Add test cases
	indirect circular references
	assert expectations about the produced graph

Dump graph as text for DebugExtensions (base DumpTrackedEntities on graph)

Add boilerplate for ObjectContext

Package this (VSIX or NuGet?) to provide an easy installation path

Update readme.md

Figure out a way to set ZoomBox Mode to Original (1:1) initially
