TODOs
----------------------------------------
Create graph of DbContext entries
	Relations
		State: How do I display removed relations? Can I? How do I distinguish between unchanged and added?
		Multiple relations between identical vertices are not displayed correctly (only the first is visible)

Filters
	re-implement using differences instead of updating the whole graph

Visualization
	Display filters a bit nicer and as an overlay like the zoom controls
	Relation tooltip needs styling (and should include the state of the relation and its multiplicity?)
	Add edge lables (relation name), might be best to switch to GraphX
		http://www.panthernet.ru/en/projects-en/graphx-en
	Check if setting the parameters of the OverlapRemovalAlgorithm improves the graph layout (try other LayoutAlgorithms)
	Figure out a way to set ZoomBox Mode to Original (1:1) initially
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6458067/how-to-set-wpfextensions-zoomcontrol-default-zoom

Add test cases
	assert expectations about the produced graph

Dump graph as text for DebugExtensions (base DumpTrackedEntities on graph)

Clean up code

Update readme.md
